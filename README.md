# 👋 Hola World! I'm Enrique

I build AI-powered developer tools at [@github](https://github.com/github).

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- **GitHub Copilot Infrastructure** - Architecting systems that bring AI directly into your development workflow
- **Agent Orchestration** - Designing how AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems
- **MCP Integration** - Pioneering extensible AI tool communication patterns

## 💡 Recent Projects

### GitHub Spark ✨
An AI-powered prototyping platform that transforms ideas into fully interactive web applications. Think of it as going from thought to deployed app in minutes, with integrated storage and AI capabilities built-in.

### Copilot Chat 🤖
Built core infrastructure and features for Copilot Chat on github.com, enabling millions of developers to have intelligent conversations with AI directly in their workflow.

### Model Context Protocol Integration 🔌
Integrated Anthropic's MCP into GitHub Copilot Chat, establishing patterns for extensible AI agent communication across platforms.

## 🎯 Philosophy

I believe AI should amplify human creativity, not replace it. The best developer tools are the ones that feel like a natural extension of your thought process: powerful enough to handle complexity, intuitive enough to get out of your way.
